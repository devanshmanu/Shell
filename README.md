Developed a mini shell which supports all basic linux commands like ls, cd, mkdir etc. Implemented background processes and signal handling along with avoiding zombie processes



---QUESTION STATEMENT----
Implement a shell which supports semi-colon separated list of commands. Use 'strtok' to tokenize the command. 

Also support '&' operator which lets a program run in background after printing the process id of the newly created process. 

The goal of the project is to create a user defined interactive shell program that can create and manage new processes. 

The shell should be able to create a process out of a system program like emacs, vi or any user-defined executable
